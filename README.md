This document will be used to track changes we make to the game.

I've created the game file Game_Draft. The game has a very rough outline so ignore the weird look and placement of items. I added the logo, start, and game screens with title and button place holders. There should be a 5 second timer for the logo screen before it switches to the start screen. The game screen should have a prompt for the end of the game after clicking on a button. The information window should also pop up after pressing the start button.

I've added the ability to shoot bubbles (currently apples) and align them to the grid. They are still relatively buggy and use example sprites, but it mostly works and should be a good basis for adding new bubbles.
