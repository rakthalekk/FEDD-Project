This document will be used to track changes we make to the game.

I've created the game file Game_Draft. The game has a very rough outline so ignore the weird placement of items. I added the logo, start, and game screens with title and button place holders. There should be a 5 second timer for the logo screen before it switches to the start screen. The game screen should have a prompt for the end of the game after clicking on a button. The information window should also pop up after pressing the start button.
